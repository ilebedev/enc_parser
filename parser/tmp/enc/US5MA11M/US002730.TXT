NOTES: 


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone 
communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed.  For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather 
broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 km / 20 to 40 nautical 
miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 186 km / 100 nautical 
miles for stations at high elevations.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 1 for important supplemental information.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown thereon.  Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S. 
Coast Guard.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 1. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE B
An Act of Congress, Public Law 90-312, declared the water-
front area to be nonnavigable.


CAUTION - BASCULE BRIDGE CLEARANCES
For bascule bridges, whose spans do not 
open to a full upright or vertical position, unlimited 
vertical clearance is not available for the entire 
charted horizontal clearance.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOTE Z - NO-DISCHARGE ZONE, 40 CFR 140
Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all 
vessels operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely prohibited 
from discharging any sewage, treated or untreated, into the waters. Commercial
vessel sewage shall include graywater. All vessels with an installed marine 
sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored, or docked 
within a NDZ must have the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of 
sewage (treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations for the 
NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot. Additional information concerning 
the regulations and requirements may be obtained from the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) web site:
