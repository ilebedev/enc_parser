Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all 
vessels operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely prohibited 
from discharging any sewage, treated or untreated, into the waters. Commercial
vessel sewage shall include graywater. All vessels with an installed marine 
sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored, or docked 
within a NDZ must have the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of 
sewage (treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations for the 
NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot. Additional information concerning 
the regulations and requirements may be obtained from the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) web site:
