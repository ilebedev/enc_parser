<h1>ISO8211Lib</h1>
<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
ISO8211Lib is intended to be a simple reader for ISO/IEC 8211 formatted files, particularly those that are part of SDTS and S-57 datasets. It consists of open source, easy to compile and integrate C++ code.<p>
<h2>ISO 8211 Background</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/tibs/iso8211/faq.html">ISO 8211 FAQ</a> has some good background on ISO 8211 formatted files. I will briefly introduce it here, with reference to the library classes representing the components.<p>
An 8211 file (<a class="el" href="classDDFModule.html">DDFModule</a>) consists of a series of logical records. The fiarst record is special, and is called the DDR (Data Description Record). It basically contains definitions of all the data objects (fields or <a class="el" href="classDDFFieldDefn.html">DDFFieldDefn</a> objects) that can occur on the following data records.<p>
The remainder of the records are known as DRs (data records - <a class="el" href="classDDFRecord.html">DDFRecord</a>). They each contain one or more field (<a class="el" href="classDDFField.html">DDFField</a>) instances. What fields appear on what records is not defined by ISO 8211, though more specific requirements may be implied by a particular data standard such as SDTS or S-57.<p>
Each field instance has a name, and consists of a series of subfields. A given field always has the same subfields in each field instance, and these subfields are defined in the DDR (<a class="el" href="classDDFSubfieldDefn.html">DDFSubfieldDefn</a>), in association with their field definition (<a class="el" href="classDDFFieldDefn.html">DDFFieldDefn</a>). A field may appear 0, 1, or many times in a DR.<p>
Each subfield has a name, format (from the <a class="el" href="classDDFSubfieldDefn.html">DDFSubfieldDefn</a>) and actual subfield data for a particular DR. Some fields contain an <em>array</em> of their group of subfields. For instance a <em>coordinate field</em> may have X and Y subfields, and they may repeat many times within one coordinate field indicating a series of points.<p>
<em>This would be a real good place for a UML diagram of ISO 8211, and the corresponding library classes!</em><p>
<h2>Development Information</h2>
<p>
The <b><a class="el" href="iso8211_8h-source.html">iso8211.h</a></b> contains the definitions for all public ISO8211Lib classes, enumerations and other services.<p>
To establish access to an ISO 8211 dataset, instantiate a <a class="el" href="classDDFModule.html">DDFModule</a> object, and then use the <a class="el" href="classDDFModule.html#f4ffa6d8f0d6f06221b94ff8082adf43">DDFModule::Open()</a> method. This will read the DDR, and establish all the <a class="el" href="classDDFFieldDefn.html">DDFFieldDefn</a>, and <a class="el" href="classDDFSubfieldDefn.html">DDFSubfieldDefn</a> objects which can be queried off the <a class="el" href="classDDFModule.html">DDFModule</a>.<p>
The use <a class="el" href="classDDFModule.html#dc0cb91dc1b1880b73d2dfacc57e2516">DDFModule::ReadRecord()</a> to fetch data records (<a class="el" href="classDDFRecord.html">DDFRecord</a>). When a record is read, a list of field objects (<a class="el" href="classDDFField.html">DDFField</a>) on that record are created. They can be queried with various <a class="el" href="classDDFRecord.html">DDFRecord</a> methods.<p>
Data pointers for individual subfields of a <a class="el" href="classDDFField.html">DDFField</a> can be fetched with <a class="el" href="classDDFField.html#778da0e37f57a48e1c39e4ee3cf1ca83">DDFField::GetSubfieldData()</a>. The interpreted value can then be extracted with the appropriate one of DDFSubfieldDefn::ExtractIntValue(), DDFSubfieldDefn::ExtractStringValue(), or DDFSubfieldDefn::ExtractFloatValue(). Note that there is no object instantiated for individual subfields of a <a class="el" href="classDDFField.html">DDFField</a>. Instead the application extracts a pointer to the subfields raw data, and then uses the <a class="el" href="classDDFSubfieldDefn.html">DDFSubfieldDefn</a> for that subfield to extract a useable value from the raw data.<p>
Once the end of the file has been encountered (<a class="el" href="classDDFModule.html#dc0cb91dc1b1880b73d2dfacc57e2516">DDFModule::ReadRecord()</a> returns NULL), the <a class="el" href="classDDFModule.html">DDFModule</a> should be deleted, which will close the file, and cleanup all records, definitions and related objects.<p>

The <a href="http://user.icx.net/~brooks/iso8211.html">ISO/IEC 8211/DDFS Home Page</a> contains tutorials and some code by Dr. Alfred A. Brooks, one of the originators of the 8211 standard.<p>

The <a href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/tibs/iso8211/iso8211.html">ISO/IEC 8211 Home Page</a> has some python code for parsing 8211 files, and some other useful background.<p>

The <a href="http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/sdts/sdtsxx/index.html">SDTS++</a> library from the USGS includes support for ISO 8211. It doesn't include some of the 1994 additions to ISO 8211, but it is sufficient for SDTS, and quite elegantly done. Also supports writing ISO 8211 files.<p>
<p>

<li>
The USGS also has an older <a href="ftp://sdts.er.usgs.gov/pub/sdts/software/fips123/">FIPS123</a> library which supports the older profile of ISO 8211 (to some extent).<p>

<h2>Building the Source</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
First, fetch the source. The most recent source should be accessable at an url such as <a href="http://home.gdal.org/projects/iso8211/iso8211lib-1.4.zip">http://home.gdal.org/projects/iso8211/iso8211lib-1.4.zip</a>.<p>
<p>
</li>
<li>
Untar the source.<p>
<code> % unzip iso8211lib-1.4.zip </code><p>
</li>
<li>
On unix you can now type ``configure'' to establish configuration options.<p>
<p>
</li>
<li>
On unix you can now type make to build libiso8211.a, and the sample mainline 8211view.<p>
<p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Windows developers will have to create their own makefile/project but can base it on the very simple Makefile.in provided. As well, you would need to copy cpl_config.h.in to cpl_config.h, and modify as needed. The default will likely work OK, but may result in some compiler warnings. Let me know if you are having difficulties, and I will prepare a VC++ makefile.<p>

I would also like to dedicate this library to the memory of Sol Katz. Sol released a variety of SDTS (and hence ISO8211) translators, at substantial personal effort, to the GIS community along with the many other generous contributions he made to the community. His example has been an inspiration to me, and I hope similar efforts on my part will contribute to his memory.<hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Tue Jul 4 10:06:07 2006 for ISO8211Lib by&nbsp;
